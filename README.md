 12. (Extra Credit) Provide a user interface that allows the user to input a string looking more or less like a usual form of a polynomial. Something like “3xˆ4 + xˆ2 + 8”, for example. The interface should also print the result as the same sort of string.
13. (Extra Credit) Any other cool thing you can think of.
14. (Super Extra Credit) Implement multivariable polynomial operations. Note: Some of your representations may have to change to accomplish this.
Submission
You may work in teams of up to two on this assignment. Note that all members of a team will receive the same grade on the assignment.
